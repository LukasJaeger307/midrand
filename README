# Midrand - The Machine ID RANDomizer

Just found `/etc/machine-id`? You don't like your machine to make itself
identifiable? You can either switch to Devuan and get ancient packages that make
Debian look shiny and new. Or you can install this little application and
randomize `/etc/machine-id` at every system boot.

## WARNING!

Depending on what applications and services you use, this MIGHT BREAK something.
Don't install this application unless you are ABSOLTELY CERTAIN that you don't
need `/etc/machine-id` for anything. I give no guarantee for any damages so be
careful.

## Installation
Midrand is an autotools application, so it's basically just cloning this
repository and doing the old

```sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Now you can randomize `/etc/machine-id` anytime you want with

```sh
sudo midrand
```

If you want to randomize it on every system boot, you need to install the
systemd service file and enable it. Assuming you are using systemd, but all the
major distros have it, so chances are good.

```sh
sudo cp midrand.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctll enable midrand.service
```

Now `/etc/machine-id` should be randomized on each system boot.
